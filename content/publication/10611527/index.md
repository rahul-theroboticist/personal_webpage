abstract: Stability and reliable operation under a spectrum of environmental conditions is still an open challenge for soft and continuum style manipulators. The inability to carry sufficient load and effectively reject external disturbances are two drawbacks which limit the scale of continuum designs, preventing widespread adoption of this technology. To tackle these problems, this work details the design and experimental testing of a modular, tendon driven bead-style continuum manipulator with tunable stiffness. By embedding the ability to independently control the stiffness of distinct sections of the structure, the manipulator can regulate it's posture under greater loads of up to 1kg at the end-effector, with reference to the flexible state. Likewise, an internal routing scheme vastly improves the stability of the proximal segment when operating the distal segment, reducing deviations by at least 70.11%. Operation is validated when gravity is both tangential and perpendicular to the manipulator backbone, a feature uncommon in previous designs. The findings presented in this work are key to the development of larger scale continuum designs, demonstrating that flexibility and tip stability under loading can co-exist without compromise.
