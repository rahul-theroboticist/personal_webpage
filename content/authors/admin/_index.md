#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am your neighbourhood robotics engineer and a freelance robotics educator. 

## About Me

I am a robotics engineer and freelance robotics educator. I enjoy conducting user case studies and finding better solutions for existing problems in the robotics field. I'm also passionate about building end-to-end systems that integrates learning algorithms, perception, planning, and control for real-world applications. 

I am an aspiring full-stack roboticist. Since my undergraduate studies, I have been exploring the world of robotics. With a B.Tech in mechatronics engineering and MSc by research (MRes) in robotics, I had worked in different areas of robotics research namely aerial robotics, marine robotics, continuum robotics and human-robot interaction and robotics manipulation.
