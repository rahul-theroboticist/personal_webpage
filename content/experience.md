        With an MSc in Robotics from the University of the West of England Bristol, UK and a B.Tech in Mechatronics Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India complemented by a semester of collaborative research at Tokai University in Japan, I bring a rigorous interdisciplinary skill set, hands-on innovation experience, and a proven track record of thriving in diverse international research settings.
        
        Over the past 8 years, I have worked in different areas of robotics, including aerial robotics, marine robotics, bio-inspired robotics, and human-robot interaction. Recently, my focus has shifted towards safe motion planning and control for dexterity and locomotion of dynamical systems.
