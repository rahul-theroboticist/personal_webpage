        I am an aspiring full-stack roboticist with 5 years of industry work experience. Since my undergraduate studies, I have been exploring the world of robotics. With a B.Tech in mechatronics engineering and MSc by research (MRes) in robotics, I had worked in different areas of robotics research namely aerial robotics, marine robotics, continuum robotics and human-robot interaction. Lately I have been focusing on motion planning and control for robotics manipulation.
