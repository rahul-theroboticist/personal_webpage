My personal website is built using [**Hugo Blox Builder**](https://hugoblox.com) and the Hugo **Academic CV Template**. 

The integrated [**Hugo Blox Builder**](https://hugoblox.com) and CMS makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free. Edit your site in the CMS (or your favorite editor), generate it with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and deploy with GitHub or Netlify. Customize anything on your site with widgets, light/dark themes, and language packs. Easily write technical content with plain text Markdown, LaTeX math, diagrams, RMarkdown, or Jupyter, and import publications from BibTeX.

The Hugo Academic CV template empowers you to easily create your job-winning online resumé, showcase your academic publications, and create online courses or knowledge bases to grow your audience.
